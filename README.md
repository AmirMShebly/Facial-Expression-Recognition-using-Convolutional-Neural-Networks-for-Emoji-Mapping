# Facial-Expression-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Emoji-Mapping
This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the FER 2013 dataset to recognize human facial expressions. The model's predictions are then used to map corresponding emojis in real-time, creating a fun and interactive application.
